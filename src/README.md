### Ideas:
- A blog (with AI auto writing it)
- App to save userCode and link fb and pics (for myself lol). (Basically gallery)
- App to search for an user in a face database (face recognition)
- A website to pet a 3D dog (with realistic hair/fur) or give headpat to a fictional character
- Analyze chatting behavior and make an AI to automate that (for lover)
- AI classification: facial chart. Like where does this face lie on the alignment chart.
- Capitalism simulator: What would happen if we raise minimum wage? And humana are coded based on basic conditions. e.g. work if saving < 150% of rent
- Automatic 1nstagram Story downloader/st4lker
