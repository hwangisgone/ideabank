### Ideas:
- A blog (with AI auto writing it)
- App to save MSSV and link fb and pics (for myself lol). (Basically gallery)
- Analyze chatting behavior and make an AI to automate that (for lover)
- AI classification: facial chart. Like where does this face lie on the alignment chart.
- Capitalism simulator: What would happen if we raise minimum wage? And humana are coded based on basic conditions. e.g. work if saving < 150% of rent
- Automatic 1nstagram Story downloader/st4lker
